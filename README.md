## Project Description
Dyslexia, a developmental reading disorder, arises from deficits in how people process the sounds of language. Our lab is conducting a study in which children and adults listen to many different speech samples (high variability training) to determine whether this exposure to variable stimuli will improve how people hear acoustic-phonetic detail in speech.

In the current version of the study, subjects must come to the lab 3-6 times to allow them to have protracted training over multiple sessions. With this type of training study, there are problems with scheduling and subject retention. We are interested in making the training more easily accessible to research subjects and in making the administration easier for us as researchers by creating either an online or app-based version of the training program. With this change, we would be able to schedule only two sessions (one at the beginning and one at the end), while subjects would be able to complete the training portion at home or another convenient location.

The online or app versions will need to be able to play sound files randomly selected from a set of sound files, collect subject responses, and send a data file of responses to us when subjects have completed the training sessions. This online/app change will greatly improve the feasibility of the larger project. 


## Information to be tracked / stored
Information can be hosted in the Cloud but we prefer to store things locally for IRB and moral issues.
- Sound files.
- User information (register, or should they OAuth with their google account / facebook account?)
